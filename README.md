The MoonLander folder holds the contents to my submitted final project.
I uploaded this folder to github from 11:58 pm to 11:59 pm, 6/8/2023.
Controls:
- move up, left, and right with the arrow keys.
- shoot with mouse click, aim with mouse.
- press enter to reset.
- if you crash into the ground, a crash animation will play.
- goal: land on the launch pad, it gives you points.
- avoid the asteroids, they will destroy you.
